# PyDataTalk

This repository contains the slides, python notebook, and source code from my talk on Intro to Neural Networks at Py Data Denver in March 2017.

Slides from my talk are in the file "IntroNeuralNets.pdf". Source code, including the python notebook with a demonstration of running the code used during my talk, is in the "src" directory.
